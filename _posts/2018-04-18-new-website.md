When I started my engineering studies I always found very hard to grasp
mathematical concepts without any intuition. Sometimes the best way to explain
the meaning of formula  to someone is to give him a practical example.

As curious individual as I am, I was looking for the most efficient way to track both
my work and my interests. I decided to use a blog because it is a good
exercise to practice writing. I'm following the example of many other
researchers that are spreading the knowledge of AI by explaining their work in a
appealing and easy way. I hope that summarizing other researchers' work and mine
would help me in the process of becoming a better scientist and at the same time
help create the necessary entropy to develop new ideas!

Thanks for reading!
