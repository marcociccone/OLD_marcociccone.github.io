I've always found it very hard to grasp mathematical concepts without any
intuition. I believe that the best way to explain the meaning of a formula, or
to interpret the results of some experiments, is to find a practical example
that clarify things. Since I started my Phd I was looking for the most efficient
way to track both my work and my interests.

Following the example of many other researchers that are spreading the knowledge
of AI, I decided to use a blog because it is a good exercise to practice with my
writing and to learn how to explain a work in a appealing and easy way. I believe
that summarizing  mine and other researchers' work would help me in the process
of becoming a better scientist and, at the same time, create the necessary
entropy to develop new ideas!

Hope it's gonna be fun!
Thanks for reading!
