I’m currently a second year PhD student at Politecnico di Milano advised by
[Prof. Matteo Matteucci](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=PdbEg5YAAAAJ&hl=en).

My background is specifically into Signal Processing and Machine Learning. At
the beginning of my studies I was mainly interested in audio signal processing,
such as unsupervised techniques for blind source separation. Then, I surrendered
to the charm of Deep Learning and during my MSc thesis I
worked on a recurrent model for [Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07053).

My research focuses on Stability and Robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs),
especially to adversarial attacks. Neural Networks are powerful and fascinating
models, that are incredibly good at generalize to new examples, but they have
been proved to be also particularly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations to
the input.  Much is still to be understood about their properties and this can
be approached from different perspectives.  I started analyzing robustness of
DNNs from a dynamical system point of view, and I'm now digging also into
[Information Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_geometry) and Optimization.

I'm also particularly interested into
[continual learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00796),
[meta-learning](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/metalearner.html),
[model adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400) and I believe
that Information Geometry can answer many open questions also in these fields.

## News
* Our paper ["NAIS-Net: Stable Deep Networks from Non-Autonomous Differential Equations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07209) has been accepted for poster presentation at [NIPS conference 2018](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/Schedule?showEvent=11308). See you in Montreal!
* I'll be joining NVIDIA for a Summer Internship in [Jan Kautz](http://research.nvidia.com/person/jan-kautz)'s team from August 2018.
* I'll be visiting [Luigi Malagò](http://www.luigimalago.it/)'s group at RIST from May 2018 to July 2018.
